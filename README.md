Dungeon game - the name isn't original, but summarizes my game pretty well. The game has 4 levels, which I have created by using the program Tiled(I recommend it if you wanna make 2d games). The player starts on level 1 all the time and has to evade enemies in order to reach the end and win the game. The player and all of his enemies have moving and some even attacking animations(all the sprites are taken from the internet). There is also tiles/objects that hurt or heal you when you collide with them. To carry out all of the things that I have written above, I used the module pygame
