Dungeon game - the name isn't original, but summarizes my game pretty well. The game will have around 4-5 levels, which I will create by using the program Tiled(I recommend it if you wanna make 2d games). The player will start on level 1 all the time and will have to evade enemies in order to reach the end and win the game. The player and all of his enemies have moving and some even attacking animations(all the sprites will be taken from the internet). There will also be tiles/objects that will hurt or heal you when you collide with them. To carry out all of the things that I have written above, I will use the module pygame
